# Numerical_Analysis


This is my labs for university numerical analysis course.

'Interpolation polynomials' contains a script that calculates a
Newton and Lagrange polynomials. Also it provides calculation of
cubic splines of a given function (not by given values, but just by a
calculated function values).

'Nonlinear equations' contains a script which provides a calculations
of a nonlinear equation using bisection, secant and Newton's methods.

There is also an implementation of a Sturm's theorem.
